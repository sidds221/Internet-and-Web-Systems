**Name of the project** : Project Reservoir

**Aim of our project** : The main aim of our project is to create a dynamic application which upon taking the reservoir data from the client will evaluate it using predictive analysis with the amount of water left in the reservoir. 

**The blueprint of our project** : 
The plan here is to create a web application such that the authorized client is able to login. The client feeds the data into the model.
Here this model will predict whether the water level is scarce or not. Also it will predict for how much time period the water will be sufficient. (Considering the outflow and inflow of the water to be constant).
We will also try to implement google maps which will display the reservoir in various regions of USA.
We will implement a graph or any statistical method for showing our results.
Lastly we will implement the search engine for searching various reservoirs from the database.

**Plan**:
Implement a predictive analysis algorithm offline and get a good accuracy.
Deploy the fine tuned algorithm on the server-side.
Implement the front-end, server and database.
Get the data, clean it and feed to the predictive analysis model to training.
Build a graph or  pie-chart or show the map of USA, divide into regions and show in color schemes.
Do the connection between the server, client and database. 
Finally build google maps.

**Technologies**:
HTML
CSS
Javascript
Python
Angular javascript
Node.js
Mongodb/mysql.
